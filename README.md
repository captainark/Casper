# Casper

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Casper 1.4 is the last release of Casper's original design, created to be compatible **ONLY with Ghost 1.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [Casper 1.3.7](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases/tag/1.3.7). For all other versions of Ghost, we recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) of Casper, with an updated design.

## Changes

This theme with its modification is used on [captainark.net](https://www.captainark.net).

List of changes from the default 1.4 version of Casper :
- wider text areas and posts ;
- some changes to code boxes ;
- smaller landing page picture and removal of the down arrow ;
- home button in the top left of every page (aside from the home page -- home icon requires fontsawesome in code injection) ;
- footer from code injection before site copyright ;
- nodebb comments (requires a nodebb installation using nodebb-plugin-blog-comments).

Use at your own risk, this is a hack job.
